# vueColors

> A VueJS website built to test and view color palettes.

Done as a practice for color theory, guidance from [Color Theory](https://tallys.github.io/color-theory/) by Natalya Shelburne. Most of the color scripts here are direct ports from her.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
